# Practical PC Skills Course — student lesson + admin monitor

## Architecture now

### 1. Every lesson describes itself

Each `phaseN/weekN.html` contains its own:

```html
<meta name="week-data" content='{
  "phase": 1,
  "week": 1,
  "title": "Meet Your Machine",
  "skills": "...",
  "status": "live",
  "phaseTitle": "Digital Foundations",
  "phaseTagline": "...",
  "phaseColorVar": "--ink"
}'>
```

The curriculum and course map fetch the lesson pages and read those tags directly. There is no `weeks-data.js` and no `build-weeks-data.js` step.

### 2. Student identity continues from the previous login page

The lesson pages use the same session key already written by the previous login page:

```js
sessionStorage.lessonDeskStudent
```

Expected value:

```js
{ id, name, classId }
```

The lesson page re-checks `students/{id}` in Firebase, then keeps the student's ID with their live activity and lesson progress.

If the session is missing, the student is sent to the configured login page and the intended lesson URL is saved as:

```js
sessionStorage.lessonDeskReturnTo
```

To automatically return to the requested lesson after the existing login script succeeds, add this one line/script to the existing login page:

```html
<script src="YOUR-PATH/assets/login-return.js"></script>
```

The helper does not replace the existing login code; it simply notices the existing `lessonDeskStudent` session and redirects to the saved lesson.

### 3. Real-time student monitoring

While a student is working, Firebase receives:

- student ID/name
- current lesson/page
- current section
- current task when available
- checklist completion percentage
- last heartbeat time
- per-lesson checklist progress

The admin page listens to `students` with Firebase `onValue`, so the dashboard updates without a manual refresh.

### 4. Access request → admin grant

Pending lessons show a request button.

The request is stored under:

```text
accessRequests/
students/{studentId}/requests/
```

Admin can:

- see the student name and ID
- see the requested lesson
- Grant access
- Delete/deny the request

Granting creates:

```text
students/{studentId}/unlocked/{weekKey}: true
```

and removes the request from both request locations.

### 5. Admin lesson editor

`admin.html` now has a lesson editor.

Admin can:

- choose any of the 12 lesson pages
- type/paste HTML
- upload an `.html`/`.htm` file
- load an existing Firebase override
- save the lesson
- remove the override and return to the original file

Saved content goes to:

```text
lessonOverrides/{weekKey}
```

Students already on the lesson receive the update through Firebase's live listener.

If a complete HTML document is uploaded, the editor extracts its body and keeps its `<style>` elements. Script tags and inline `on...` event attributes are removed before saving.

### 6. Read aloud

`assets/read-aloud.js` provides:

- Play/pause
- Stop
- Male/female voice choice
- normal speaking speed (`1.0`)
- automatic selection of the best available English natural/neural voice exposed by the visitor's browser/OS

The exact voice is controlled by the student's Windows/browser voice inventory. A web page cannot guarantee a recorded human voice without a separate TTS provider or hosted audio service.

### 7. DevTools deterrent

`assets/devtools-guard.js` blocks common:

- F12
- Ctrl+U
- Ctrl+Shift+I
- Ctrl+Shift+J
- Ctrl+Shift+C
- right click

This is only a browser deterrent. It is not a security boundary. Real access control must be enforced by Firebase rules/server-side authentication.

## Firebase configuration

`assets/firebase-config.js` contains the Firebase project configuration taken from the supplied student login code.

The lesson portal expects the same database structure already used by the login page:

```text
students/{studentId}
admins/{adminId}
accessRequests/{requestId}
lessonOverrides/{weekKey}
```

## Important security note

The current student login is a custom database credential check, so the browser can technically be manipulated. The admin page is likewise protected by the existing `admins` database check.

For strong production security, move student/admin authentication to Firebase Authentication and enforce per-user Firebase Realtime Database rules. The client-side F12 protection must never be treated as protection for passwords or private data.


### 8. Phase / week access management

- Week 1 is permanently open to every student.
- Weeks 2–12 are always individual-request lessons.
- There is no global “open lesson” mode for Weeks 2–12.
- A student can request only the next lesson after the previous lesson has been granted (Week 1 is the automatic starting point).
- A request records the student, requested week, previous week and request time.
- Admin reviews each request individually and can grant access only to that requesting student's account.
- Granting creates:
  `students/{studentId}/unlocked/{weekKey}: true`
- The request is then removed from the pending queue.
- The student receives a personal access-granted notification.

### 9. Teacher review before the next lesson

The student request panel explains that the previous lesson must be understood before the next lesson is granted.

The student can fast-track a request by chatting with the teacher on WhatsApp:

```text
+234 912 922 5442
```

The teacher can check the student's practical skills, ask questions, or give the student a project/assessment before granting the next lesson.

The admin request queue shows the previous lesson and its saved checklist progress where available. Each pending request has:

- Message / Project
- Grant access
- Delete request

### 10. Request-specific notifications and assignments

Notifications and assignments are no longer sent through a general audience system.

The admin communication area requires a specific pending next-lesson request first. It automatically targets:

- the requesting student only
- the requested next lesson
- the request ID

A project/assessment can therefore be sent to the student before access is granted, allowing the teacher/admin to check understanding of the previous lesson.

Granting access automatically sends a personal notification to that student only.

Assignments are stored with:

```text
assignments/{assignmentId}
requestId
requestWeek
previousWeek
recipients/{studentId}: true
```

The student notification centre displays only assignments addressed to that student. Request-specific projects are also shown in the admin request-project history.

### 11. Security note

The browser UI now prevents the old global lesson-opening path, but Firebase Realtime Database rules remain the actual security boundary. The rules should ensure that students cannot write their own `unlocked` records or another student's notifications/assignments.



## Rebuilt student access workflow

This version removes the old external/school login engine.

### Student login
Students use:
- Student ID
- Passcode

The administrator creates the account from `admin.html`. Passcodes are stored as SHA-256 hashes for newly created accounts. Existing seed accounts are migrated to `passcodeHash`.

### Lesson progression
- Week 1 is always open.
- Weeks 2–12 are locked until that individual student is granted access.
- The student requests only the next week.
- The request appears immediately in Admin → Lesson Requests.
- Admin can review progress, send a notification, send a practical assignment/assessment, then grant access.
- Granting creates `students/{studentId}/unlocked/{weekKey}: true`.
- The student's current lesson immediately changes to an **Access granted / Open Week** button through Firebase realtime listeners.

### Lesson editing
Admin → Lessons supports:
1. Type/paste HTML.
2. Upload an HTML/HTM file.
3. Save an external HTTP/HTTPS lesson URL. The student portal embeds it when the remote server permits iframe embedding and also provides an Open Lesson button.

### Important Firebase security limitation
Because the requested Admin page has **no administrator login**, Firebase cannot cryptographically distinguish the administrator from an ordinary visitor. The included `firebase-rules.json` is therefore intentionally open so the requested no-login admin workflow can operate.

For a public production deployment, do not use open write rules. The secure version should add Firebase Authentication/custom claims or a server-side admin API. The student passcode screen is a convenience access layer, not a substitute for Firebase Authentication.
